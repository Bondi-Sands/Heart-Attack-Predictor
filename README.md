# Heart-Attack-Predictor
I used R and PowerBI to visualize and analyze the Heart Attack Analysis & Prediction Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashikrahmanpritom/heart-attack-analysis-prediction-dataset?select=heart.csv).

In PowerBI, I used the dataset to create visualizations such as scatter plots and clustered column charts to compare the different variables. In R, I imported the dataset and used the ggplot2 package to create boxplots and bar plots to visualize the data. I used the data to perform some predictive analysis, such as logistic regression, to determine the probability of a patient suffering from a heart attack given their age, gender, cholesterol level, etc.
